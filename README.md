# Birthday-Bot

  This discord bot was created by Arturo Salazar, with the help of Evan Nguyen and Justin Ko. It was created for the purpose of reminding those in my friend group who forget people's birthdays. It's a pretty basic bot that uses discord's api and python. It allows the user to see a list of everyone's birthday, as well as type a specific persons name and get their birthday and also has a command that displays the next upcoming birthday based on the current date.
