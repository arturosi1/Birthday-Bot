# Birthday-Bot

  This discord bot was created by Arturo Salazar, with the help of Evan Nguyen and Justin Ko. It was created for the purpose of reminding those in my friend group who forget people's birthdays. It's a pretty basic bot that uses discord's api and python. It allows the user to see a list of everyone's birthday, as well as type a specific persons name and get their birthday and also has a command that displays the next upcoming birthday based on the current date.

    Bot commands:
      !bday all
          - Like previously mentioned, this displays the entire list of everyone of my friends birthdays in order by date
      !bday [someone's name]
          - This will display the birthday of the name inputted
      !bday next
          - This will display the next birthday coming up based on the current date. Ex: Today's date is 01/04 then the next birthday coming up is Arturo Salazar - January 16th
